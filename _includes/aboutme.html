            <h5>Experience</h5>
            <p>Through my over a decade of career and research I have developed solid knowledge and experience in the
                fields of cyber security, software development and system administration. This knowledge consists
                of both deep technical knowledge as well as management and organization
                experience to bridge the gap between the various security and engineering teams and C-level management.
            </p>
            <h5>Passion</h5>
            <p>I have a passion for learning about Microsoft-based technology from the sysadmin perspective, and then
                applying it in offensive operations, sharing the insights with the global security community. Moreover,
                I love bringing order into
                chaos and implementing technology into business processes.</p>
