Regardless of the security measures implemented, there is always a possibility of an attacker getting access to the environment. In case such event happens it is key to make quick and resolute decisions on how to proceed.

### Approach
Depending on the situation the following activities can be performed:

- Get the systems running again as soon as possible;
- Identify the systems that are affected and any backdoors that might be installed;
- Identify the way the attacker managed to compromise the network or system;
- Collect forensic evidence of the attack;
- Perform forensic analysis on any malware identified.

At our first moment of contact we will decide which activities are relevant to your situation.

### Experience
In my career I have been working on a variety of incidents ranging from infected workstations at a bank to a malfunctioning PLC in an industrial network. At these incidents I was both involved from a management perspective as well as in the deep technical investigations.
